First game using Unity (this won't be pretty)
As the title says, this is my first time using Unity. I don't know any of the conventions or anything, so right now as long as something works and does what I want I keep it. I'm also a terrible artist, so the game is not going to look very nice.
That being said if anyone has any tips, tricks, or suggestions for improvements I would be very glad to hear them. I am doing this mostly to learn, so any help is greatly appreciated. You can email me at GitHub email address.
